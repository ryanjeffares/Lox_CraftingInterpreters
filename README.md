# Lox_CraftingInterpreters

This is the repository in which I show my attempt at following along and expanding upon [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) by Robert Nystrom. It contains the code for the two interpreters implemented, as well as my notes. My notes are not an exhaustive list of notes at every step, just some things that I thought were interesting or new to me.
